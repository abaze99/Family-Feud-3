# Family Feud
Family feud is America's favorite family show, where families compete against each other in a survey based game. <a href="https://agrushcow.github.io/family-feud/">Family Feud</a> is an API driven web app that takes the user through a series of survey questions.


# Introduction
Family Feud uses API calls to a weather based API that provides weather related data. This data populates the quiz with a combination of questions and survey answers. 

# How it works 
This app uses jquery to make changes to the front-end display. Additionally, AJAX calls are made to pull data from the weather API. The user will provide answers to a variety of questions, where they will either successfully answer all the survey answers or get three incorrect. At that point they will be moved onto the next question, until they reach the conclusion of the game, at which point they will receive their overall score.
